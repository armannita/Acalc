Thanks for Installing the MSI for ACALC!
---------------------------------------------------------

if you think Oh is just a GUI Calculator WRONG!
It is a Text-Based calculator written in C# by me (arman_nita) in late 2022 or early 2023
I only use the source code from ChatGPT as a test of the World of coding





How it Works:

Well there's nothing just a calculator



Early Testing Stage:

at a version I call it 0.1 if you type in such as "jasdjasjdasj" it will crash ChatGPT changed it to 1.0 so the bug does not happen and it will be only "invalid input"



Yeah that's what I need to say in this README

Have a nice day,

Arman
